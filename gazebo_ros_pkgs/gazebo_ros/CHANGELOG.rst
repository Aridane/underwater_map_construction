  replace time.sleep by rospy.Rate.sleep

  time was not even imported, so I don't know
  why this could ever have worked...
* Add time import
  When using the -wait option the script fails because is missing the time import

  full path for include files. For example,
  `include <physics/physics.hh>` will not be valid
  `include <gazebo/physics/physics.hh>` must be done instead.
* update gazebo includes
* Fixed a minor typo in spawn_model error message when `-model` not specified
