# How to Contribute

We welcome contributions to this repo and encourage you to fork the project, thanks!

## Issues and Pull Requests

There are several maintainers of different packages in this repository. If you
are submitting an issue or a pull request, please prefix the title of the issue
or pull resquest with the package name. This way the appropriate maintainers
can more easily recognize contributions which require their attention.

## Style 

We follow the [C++ ROS style guidelines](http://ros.org/wiki/CppStyleGuide) and 
conventions as closely as possible. However, because the plugins inherit from Gazebo 
classes and Gazebo follows a very different formatting standard, there are a few 
exceptions where Gazebo's function names do not comply to the ROS guidelines.
