2.3.5 (2014-03-26)
------------------
* gazebo_ros: [less-than-minor] fix newlines

* Contributors: Paul Mathieu

2.3.4 (2013-11-13)
------------------
* remove debug statement
* fix sdf spawn with initial pose
* fix sdf spawn with initial pose
* Merge branch 'hydro-devel' into ``spawn_model_pose_fix``
* fix indentation
* Merge pull request `#142 <https://github.com/ros-simulation/gazebo_ros_pkgs/issues/142>`_ from hsu/hydro-devel
  fix issue `#38 <https://github.com/ros-simulation/gazebo_ros_pkgs/issues/38>`_, gui segfault on model deletion
* Merge pull request `#140 <https://github.com/ros-simulation/gazebo_ros_pkgs/issues/140>`_ from ``v4hn/spawn_model_sleep``
  replace time.sleep by rospy.Rate.sleep
* fix spawn initial pose.  When model has a non-zero initial pose and user specified initial model spawn pose, add the two.
* fix issue `#38 <https://github.com/ros-simulation/gazebo_ros_pkgs/issues/38>`_, gui segfault on model deletion by removing an obsolete call to set selected object state to "normal".
* replace time.sleep by rospy.Rate.sleep
  time was not even imported, so I don't know
  why this could ever have worked...
* Add time import
  When using the -wait option the script fails because is missing the time import

* Fix iterator erase() problems

2.3.3 (2013-10-10)

2.3.2 (2013-09-19)
------------------
* Make gazebo includes use full path
  In the next release of gazebo, it will be required to use the
  full path for include files. For example,
  `include <physics/physics.hh>` will not be valid
  `include <gazebo/physics/physics.hh>` must be done instead.
* update gazebo includes
* Fixed a minor typo in spawn_model error message when `-model` not specified

2.3.1 (2013-08-27)
------------------
* Cleaned up template, fixes for header files

------------------

2.2.0 (2013-07-29)
